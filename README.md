# Pygmy

A Python interface to the Gmail API used to backup and modify emails

- [Abhishek Chhibber](https://github.com/abhishekchhibber) wrote the original [Gmail-API-through-Python](https://github.com/abhishekchhibber/Gmail-Api-through-Python), and did a better job than the Google API documentation of showing how to retrieve and decode email objects. Some of his code probably lives on in this project today.

# Quick start
The Gmail API Python quickstart documentation can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python).

In short, once Python is installed,  set up a virtual environment, activate it and
run the following code to install the Google Client Library:

```
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```
